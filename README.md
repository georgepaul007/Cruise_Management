# Cruise_Management

This is a C++ program to do various tasks in relation to setting up a cruise trip for the users. 
We can ask the user for the different amenities they require in the cruise and the start and end locations as to where they want to travel and with this, we can generate the bill based on the general cost of the cruise and display this bill to the user. 
We can also assign reg nos to the users who have generated a bill for a trip they have entered and this is stored in a file which persists and hence later with the reg no of the user, we can retrieve an old bill to a trip. 
We can also edit different bills generated to generate new bills incase the users change their mind on some of the amenities which they have selected during registration.
